<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! I am Hanyang, you can call me Brace or OptionsGod (I don't mean to trade options well, but I want to be good when facing options). I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University. Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics at Fudan University and my master degree in Financial Engineering also at Columbia.

My main research focus has been on generative models, including LLMs and diffusion models. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wenpin Tang](https://www.columbia.edu/~wt2319/) and Professor [David D. Yao](https://www.columbia.edu/~yao/).
