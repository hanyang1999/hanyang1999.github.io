<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi! <!--I am Hanyang, you can call me <tt>Brace</tt> or <tt>OptionsGod</tt> (I don't mean to trade options well, but I want to be good when facing options).--> I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University and I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wenpin Tang](https://www.columbia.edu/~wt2319/) and Professor [David D. Yao](https://www.columbia.edu/~yao/). Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics at Fudan University and my M.S. in Financial Engineering also at Columbia.

I am interested in generative models, including LLMs and diffusion models. Recently, I am working on generative models alignment (RLHF).
